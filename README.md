# bids-matlab-tools

This repository contains a collection of function to import and export BIDS-formated experiments. The code is tailored for use in EEGLAB but may also be used independently of EEGLAB. Conversion of data format from non-supported BIDS binary format require that EEGLAB be installed (supported formats are EEGLAB .set files, EDF files, BDF files, and Brain Vision Exchange Format files).

# Use with EEGLAB

Simply place the code in the plugin folder of EEGLAB and it will be automatically detected by EEGLAB.
